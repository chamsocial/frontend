<p>We use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the Site. By using the Site, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
<h2>Information Collection And Use</h2>
<p>While using the Site, you may provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you by us or by other members of the Site.

<p>Should you wish to delete your account, please contact the site administrators.</p>
<h2>Log Data</h2>
<p>Like many site operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site ("Log Data").</p>
<p>This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics. This information is vital for the diagnosis of any problems that may occur on the Site and to monitor the performance of the Site.</p>
<p>We also retain logs of email activity (both in and out), which is important for investigating delivery issues and measuring activity.</p>
<p>In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this data.</p>
<h2>Communications</h2>
<p>As part of the normal operation of the Site, you may be sent notifications by email or other mechanisms, and options are provided that allow you to choose how often messages are sent. Site administrators may contact you in relation to your account independent of these settings.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Cookies are files containing small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer, and your browser sends them back to the site when you visit again. You can instruct your browser to refuse or filter cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of the Site.</p>
<h2>Acceptable use and content</h2>
<p>Chamsocial enables people from diverse backgrounds to start conversations, debate topics, share experiences, collaborate on projects, and form new communities, and we want it to remain a friendly, safe environment. To this end we do not allow content or behaviour in the following categories:</p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Illegal Activities</li>
        <li>Malicious or Deceptive Practices</li>
        <li>Hate Speech</li>
        <li>Harassment, Bullying, and Threats</li>

        <li>Account Hijacking</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>Accounts that do any of these things may have posts deleted and if they are persistent or appear to have been created solely for malicious purposes, the accounts will be closed and activity reported to authorities if applicable. Note that these restrictions are based on the policies applied by Facebook and Google, for the same reasons.</p>
<h2>Advertising</h2>
<p>The Site has allowed many forms of advertising since its inception. This will continue and may be extended to allow commercial, untracked (i.e. not involving scripts or cookies) advertising or sponsorship. We may provide aggregate statistics to advertisers, but under no circumstances will we provide Personal Information to advertisers.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. All communications with the Site enforces use of strong encryption, but it is up to you to ensure that your browser software is able to take advantage of the security features offered.</p>
<h2>Jurisdiction &amp; location</h2>
<p>The Site is hosted in France, and is subject to EU data protection regulations. Your data will not be transferred outside the EU, though content on the Site may be viewed by users outside the EU.</p>
<p>Activity, Personal Information or Log Data will be provided to law enforcement authorities only when the law requires it and when accompanied by an applicable court order.</p>
<h2>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>
